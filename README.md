## Port of src/stopwatch.html to a React version


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Minimal state:

* starttime
* currenttime
* buttonstate


warning: Cannot update during an existing state transition (such as within `render`). 
Render methods should be a pure function of props and state.
